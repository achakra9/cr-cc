## CR-CC methods
A step-by-step guide of running CR-CC methods using pyscf. This script can also be used with other codes if the t and l amplitudes are provides.

#### CR-CC(2,3)
[ ] - First run CCSD calculations using PySCF
[ ] - Obtain the t1 and t2 amplitudes
[ ] - Run left-CCSD calculation
[ ] - Obtain the l1 and l2 amplitudes
[ ] - Run the CR-CC(2,3) correction to CCSD
